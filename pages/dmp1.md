**Swords of the 1800s \- 19th Century Swords of the World**

**Data Management Plan**

**Project Description**

Our project focuses on swords, specifically those manufactured and used during the 1800s. We want our repository to display these weapons from around the world, along with brief descriptions of where the swords were used and by whom they were used. Our project is hosted on a GitHub repository that uses an extension called “collection builder.” This extension formats items to be more approachable and is open source.

To coordinate the data, we had to work together to make sure we were saving and storing data in the same way, using the same naming conventions, file types, and having similarly length descriptions across the board. Since we are a group of two, we didn't assign specific roles for each of us; rather, we work together on the tasks or assign as we go. 

**Anticipated Data**

Briefly describe how your data was collected.

In order to collect our data for the project, we used multiple public repositories such as: The MET, The Smithsonian, and Oregon Digital. Once we found items that suited the requirements, we would download the image, rename it, and add it to our shared Google Drive folder. We would also use the descriptions from the documents, sometimes summarizing or shortening them to be concise. 

In the table, group it by file type, then sum up the \# of items, the size in MB, and data sources for each grouping.

| Item Description | File Type | Size (in MB) | \# of Items | License(s) | Sources |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Image of Sword** | **.Jpeg**  | **15 mb** | **20** | **CC0** | **The MET; Smithsonian; Oregon Digital** |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Documentation and Metadata**

To access our metadata, navigate to our GitHub page, and it is fully available under the asset folder. We will make sure to have a link on all our images in the collection back to the source we got it from (The MET, Smithsonian, and Oregon Digital), so visitors of our website can get more detailed descriptions or more images of a sword if they want to. This link will likely be when you click the image to inspect it closer, below the description. For our data dictionary, it is displayed on this page if you scroll down.

**Storage and Backup**

Our metadata is in a shared Google Sheet, meaning that we can both access it from multiple devices, and it is backed up on each of our Google Drives. The repository is made on GitHub, which is connected to both of our GitHub accounts. For the collection images, we both have the ones we found individually saved to our computers, however, we also add each of the images to the shared GitHub. Additionally, we use a Google Doc to put all the sources of each image, so if something happens to one of the images, we can always get another one. 

**Data Sharing**

Our data collection is shared exclusively on GitHub, however, all of the data found within the collection can be found on the websites linked within each object on our collection on the GitHub pages-hosted website. Every object in our collection can be reused as it falls under either the public domain or the Creative Commons Zero license. If you wish to download the image, you can navigate to the museum's original webpage or go to the object folder on the GitHub where all images are readily available.

**Period of Data Retention**

This project will remain available as long as GitHub does, as the metadata will live inside the repository, and without any complications such as GitHub shoving the website aside because of a lack of user interaction, should last as long as GitHub servers do.

**Licensing and Ethical Issues**

As stated earlier, every object in our collection is licensed under the Public Domain or Creative Commons 0, which means they can be used under essentially any circumstances and can be found in the places listed in previous sections.
