**Swords of the 1800s \- 19th Century Swords of the World**

**Data Management Plan**

**Project Description**

Describe the project, its topic, and its technical requirements.

Our project focuses on swords, specifically those manufactured and used during the 1800s. We want our repository to display these weapons from around the world, along with brief descriptions of where the swords were used and by whom they were used.


Outline the rights and obligations of all parties with respect to their roles and responsibilities in data management. As a collaborative project, explain the coordination of data management responsibilities across partners.

To coordinate the data, we had to work together to make sure we were saving and storing data in the same way, using the same naming conventions, file types, and having similarly length descriptions across the board. Since we are a group of two, we didn't assign specific roles for each of us; rather, we work together on the tasks or assign as we go. 

**Anticipated Data**

Briefly describe how your data was collected.

In order to collect our data for the project, we used multiple public repositories such as: The MET, The Smithsonian, and Oregon Digital. Once we found items that suited the requirements, we would download the image, rename it, and add it to our shared Google Drive folder. We would also use the descriptions from the documents, sometimes summarizing or shortening them to be concise. 

In the table, group it by file type, then sum up the \# of items, the size in MB, and data sources for each grouping.

| Item Description | File Type | Size (in MB) | \# of Items | License(s) | Sources |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Image of Sword** | **.Jpeg .Jpg** | **120MB (?)** | **20** | **CC0** | **The MET Smithsonian Oregon Digtital** |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Documentation and Metadata**

This section should describe relevant documentation and where it can be accessed. Your data dictionary, once completed, is excellent documentation\! Where and how do you plan on providing it to your audience?

We will make sure to have a link on all our images in the collection back to the source we got it from (The MET, Smithsonian, and Oregon Digital), so visitors of our website can get more detailed descriptions or more images of a sword if they want to. This link will likely be when you click the image to inspect it closer, below the description. For our data dictionary, we will have it displayed somewhere on our repository, possibly in its own section.

**Storage and Backup**

This section should describe where your **metadata, repository, and collection images** are stored and if they are backed up. Do you have local backups? Backups on cloud storage? 

Hint: Your data dictionary, once completed, is excellent documentation\! Where and how do you plan on provide it to your audience?

Our metadata is in a shared Google Sheet, meaning that we can both access it from multiple devices, and it is backed up on each of our Google Drives. The repository is made on GitHub, which is connected to both of our GitHub accounts. For the collection images, we both have the ones we found individually saved to our computers, however, we also add each of the images to the shared GitHub. Additionally, we use a Google Doc to put all the sources of each image, so if something happens to one of the images, we can always get another one. 

**Data Sharing**

This section should describe how and on what platforms your data is shared. If there are potential cases for reuse, you should describe how your data will be made available to people who want to reuse it.

Our data collection is shared exclusively on GitHub, however, all of the data found within the collection can be found on the websites linked within each object on our collection. Every object in our collection can be reused as it falls under either the public domain or the Creative Commons Zero license.

**Period of Data Retention**

This section should address how long your group plans to maintain each component of the project before and after it has been submitted for grading.

This project will remain available as long as GitHub does, as the metadata will live inside the repository, and without any complications, should last as long as GitHub servers do.

**Licensing and Ethical Issues**

Use this section to outline the intellectual property rights of your created material.  What are the terms under which others may use these materials? If your data and products raise any potential ethical issues, use this section to address those matters.

As stated earlier, every object in our collection is licensed under the Public Domain or Creative Commons 0, which means they can be used under essentially any circumstances.
